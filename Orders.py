"""
Orders.py - Order Management (PLACEHOLDER)

Module Goal: Central platform for sending, managing, and maintaining orders.

Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Placeholder for future use

Currently, the bot operates in backtesting mode only. Order execution would be
implemented here when live trading is needed.

Primary Bot Workflow (current implementation):
- Discord messages → Signal.py → Test.py (backtesting only)
- No live order execution currently implemented

PLACEHOLDER - Not part of active workflow

# import Config

# TODO: Future implementation could include:
# - Broker integration (Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, etc.)
# - Order state management
# - Position tracking
# - Risk management checks before order submission
# - Order modification and cancellation
#
# For now, the bot only runs backtests - see Test.py for simulation logic
